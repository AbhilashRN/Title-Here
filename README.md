## Special Precipitation Index to predict drought and potential floods

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) expresses the actual rainfall as standardized departure from rainfall probability distribution function and, hence, this index has gained importance in recent years as a potential drought indicator permitting comparisons across space and time. Title-here intends to predict droughts and potential floods by computing spi by averaging data over last 30 years.
