## Special Precipitation Index to predict drought and potential floods
Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) expresses the actual rainfall as standardized departure from rainfall probability distribution function and, hence, this index has gained importance in recent years as a potential drought indicator permitting comparisons across space and time. Title-here intends to predict droughts and potential floods by computing SPI by averaging data over last 30 years. Computation of SPI requires long term data on precipitation to determine the probability distribution function which is then transformed to normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of one.Computation of SPI with time series data, at a monthly scale, was carried out based on the two parameter gamma distribution function.

## Predicting Frost Frequency from Cloud Cover and Minimum Temperature 
Perennial crops are prone to be damaged from late-spring frost events. Title-Here intends to predict the frost frequency in a month by taking in Cloud Cover, Minumim Temperature and Max-Min Difference as input variables and treating it as a regression problem.
